                <h2>Research aims</h2>
                <p>
                    Sanctuaries and other sacred places constitute an invaluable source of information in Italic communities. At least as important as the sacred places themselfse, however, is their relationship to other elements in the cultural landscape, such as settlements, necropoleis and roads, this 'landscape of the sacred' is essential for out understanding of the changing functions and cultural meaning of sactuaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A major problem affecting the study of the sactuaries of southern and central Italy is the frequent absence of information about their spatial context. It is this lacuna in the arcaeological record that the 'Sacred Landscape Project' aims to reduce and various intensive field surveys around selected Italic sancuaries are now sheduled.

                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <p>
                    We surveyed the sample area in units with a maximum of 50 by 100 m (0.5 ha) at 10 m intervals between field walkers, which corresponds to a 20 per cent coverage. All artefacts were collected, washed and classified (Fig. 3). In units in which there were too many tiles to collect, these were counted in small sample areas of 1 m2 to make an estimate of the overall quantity. The fields immediately surrounding the cult place have been sampled more intensively in units of 10 x 10 m, giving a theoretical coverage of 100 per cent. The result is a detailed artefact density contour map of the area around the temple. The idea behind this strategy was to be able to detect possible adjacent structures. This 100 per cent coverage sampling strategy also helped us to form as complete an image as possible of the finds belonging to the sanctuary site, enabling a refinement of the chronology and the repertoire of small finds.

                    Site identification was primarily based on observed relative contrasts in find densities. For Hellenistic and Roman sites, a general minimum of five shards per square meter has been adopted. After having pinpointed potential sites the standard transect survey was completed before investigating the high density areas in more detail. In drawing the boundaries of the haloâ€™s and nuclei, relative contrasts in find densities were preferred to fixed thresholds. Additional diagnostic finds were collected for dating and functional analysis. A handheld GPS was used to record the coordinates of the halo and nuclei of the find concentrations encountered. During the 2005 survey, PDA computers with a connected GPS were used in the field for both navigation and data input.3 Both survey unit boundaries and site contours were mapped on 1:10.000 maps of the region.

                    For each unit, the land use, erosion processes when noted, tillage and various visibility factors (stones, shade, vegetation, soil humidity, presence of recent material) were recorded. These factors determined the final visibility. Observations about the geo-morphological situation, present land use, tillage and modern alterations to the landscape were also noted. This information about the landscape was integrated into the chronological and functional analysis of the finds carried out, and thus our field data could be corrected for biases which amongst other results has resulted in the recognition of sites missed in the field.
