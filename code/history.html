                <h2>History of the Samnites</h2>
                <p>The earliest written record of the people is a treaty with the Romans from 354 BC, which set their border at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liri" target="_blank" class="mw-redirect" title="Liris River">Liris River</a>. Shortly thereafter, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samnite_Wars" target="_blank" title="Samnite Wars">Samnite Wars</a> broke out; they won an important battle against the Roman army in 321 BC, and their <i>imperium</i> reached its peak in 316 BC, after further gains from the Romans. By 290 BC, the Romans were able to break the Samnites' power after some hard fought battles. The Samnites were one of the Italian peoples that allied with King <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus" target="_blank" title="Pyrrhus of Epirus">Pyrrhus of Epirus</a> during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_War" target="_blank" title="Pyrrhic War">Pyrrhic War</a>. After Pyrrhus left for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily" target="_blank" title="Sicily">Sicily</a>, the Romans invaded Samnium and were crushed at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Cranita_hills" target="_blank"  title="Battle of the Cranita hills">Battle of the Cranita hills</a>, but after the defeat of Pyrrhus, the Samnites could not resist on their own and submitted to Rome.

By 82 BC, the Roman dictator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulla" target="_blank" class="mw-redirect" title="Lucius Cornelius Sulla">Lucius Cornelius Sulla</a> conducted an ethnic cleansing campaign against this most stubborn and persistent of Rome's adversaries and forced the remnant to disperse. So great was the destruction brought upon them that it was recorded that "the towns of Samnium have become villages, and most have vanished altogether."<sup id="cite_ref-strabo_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-strabo-2">[2]</a></sup>

                <h2>Samnium</h2>
                <p>
                    Ancient authors attribute an important role to the Samnites Pentri in Italic resistance to Roman expansion, from the Samnite Wars in the second half of the 4th century BC right up to the Social War in the early first sentury BC. Ont long debated aspect of Samnite society is its political and social organization, which seems to have functioned within a rather de-centralized territorial arrangement. In this context, sanctuaries are often assigned a pivotal role as central places with political and commercial as well as religious functions. In out viw, it is this aggregative quality that makes the analysis of sanctuaries so valuable for the study of socio-political changes in Samnite communities.

                <p>
                    The lavish attention devotes to sanctuaries by Samnite society, as reflected in the building and embellishment activities in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, is striking, especially when they are compared to other public buildings or domestic architecture of the period. The architectural forms chosen and the dedications made suggest that in these places specific group identities were being articulated. These common identities may have assumed ethnic connotations under specific historical circymstances.
